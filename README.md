## Abstract

[Fungibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungibility) is an essential property of good money. Since the invention of [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) in 2008 countless fungibility improvements have been proposed, implemented, deployed and used. Some of them builds on top of Bitcoin, some of them invented their own cryptocurrencies to address the privacy issue. As of today, 2017 no proposal, including privacy centric altcoins addressed the problem in its full scale. No proposal attempted to provide protections against all the different ways a user's privacy can be breached. As a result, we are still not able to transact in a fully anonymous way. The Bitcoin Anonymity Framework is the first attempt to do that. It combines all the research and techniques in a practical and coherent way.  
The scope of AnonWork is limited to Bitcoin's first layer. As long as the Bitcoin network is being used, there will always be need for on-chain privacy. Even if an off-chain privacy solution, like the [TumbleBit Payment Hub](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/575.pdf) gets deployed and adopted, the entrance and exit transactions will always happen on-chain.  
**The main goal of AnonWork is to make a set of coins unlinkable to another set of coins.**  
Furthermore the authors are committed to also build and deploy a production ready implementation, therefore not get stucked in the research phase.
